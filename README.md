MakAir ‚Äî Covid-19 Respirator
=====

**3D printable Covid-19 DIY respirator (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Aims at helping hospitals cope with a possible shortage of professional respirators during the outbreak.**

We are a distributed team of 50+ contributors, mostly spread through France. Makers, developers, university teachers, researchers and medical teams collaborated on this project. Our testing assembly operations are located in Nantes, France.

If you're new there, please read the explanations below. _Your contributions are much welcome!_

# Concept

Roughly, the idea is as follow: hospitals will soon lack mechanical artificial respirators. We aim at building a pump, and a valve system (controlled by electronics). This way, the breathing cycle can be enforced by proper air routing through the valve system.

The overall system is composed of sub-components that can be plugged together and wired to form an air circuit, namely:

- **Air pump** (called "Blower");
- **Air pump casing fit** (called "Blower Holder");
- **Valve system** (called "Pressure Valve");
- **Oxygen Mixer valve** (called "Oxygen Mixer");
- **Air filter casing (machine variant)** (called "Machine Filter Box"; 2 directions);
- **Air filter casing (patient variant)** (called "Patient Filter Box");

In order to ensure a proper breathing cycle (inhale + exhale), multiple valves need to be connected together to form a circuit. The motors needs to be controlled in harmony so that the air routing between each valve unit is consistent.
