# Concept

Roughly, the idea is as follow: hospitals will soon lack mechanical artificial respirators. We aim at building a pump, and a valve system (controlled by electronics). This way, the breathing cycle can be enforced by proper air routing through the valve system.

The overall system is composed of sub-components that can be plugged together and wired to form an air circuit, namely:

- **The air pump** (called "Blower");
- **The valve system** (called "Air Transistor");

In order to ensure a proper breathing cycle (inhale + exhale), multiple valves need to be connected together to form a circuit. The motors needs to be controlled in harmony so that the air routing between each valve unit is consistent.
